# Getting Started with Jupyter

This folder contains a `.devcontainer` configuration that can be used with Docker and VSCode. To get started you need to: 

1. Download the Repository from GitHub

2. Open the DevContainer in VSCode

3. Run then Cells in `hej.ipynb`


## 1. Download the Repository from GitHub

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/algomentor/jupyter-example.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd jupyter-example
    ```

## 2. Open the DevContainer in VSCode

1. Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.

2. Open VSCode using `code .` from within the folder.

3. Click Reopen Folder in Container via the lower left corner of VSCode.

4. VSCode will now build and open the devcontainer.

## 3. Run then Cells in `hej.ipynb`

1. Once the devcontainer is running, open `hej.ipynb` from the Explorer sidebar in VSCode.

2. You will see the notebook interface. Click on any cell to select it.

3. Run a cell by clicking the "Run" button (a triangle icon) at the top of the cell, or press `Shift + Enter`.

4. Repeat this process for each cell you want to run.

## Yay!

You're now ready to start working with your Jupyter notebook in the VSCode devcontainer environment.
